# rbx1_ros
ROS Implementation of the [RBX-1 Robot Arm from Roboteurs](https://roboteurs.com/products/rbx1-remix-3d-printed-6-axis-robot-arm-kit).

Uses [ROS MoveIt!](https://moveit.ros.org/) for motion planning, and [Unity3d](https://unity.com/) for simulation.  Unity integration is accomplished through the use of [ROS#}(https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp).

Intent is to provide a very low cost robot arm for experimentation and R&D, with a rich simulation environment enabling Reinforcement Learning.
